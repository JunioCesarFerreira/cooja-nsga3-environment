# cooja-nsga3-environment

 Scripts for using Cooja as a simulator and NSGA-III for multi-objective optimization in fog computing environments.


## About the Current Version

In the current version we have already prepared the [Cooja environment](./simulation). However the use of python scripts and mysql still need to be implemented. And in the next phase the integration with NSGA.

Additionally, if you want to explore just the containerized Cooja see [docker-cooja](./docker-cooja).
